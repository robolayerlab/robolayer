# RoboLayer Architecture

## Overview

RoboLayer is designed as a modular execution layer that sits between off-chain robotics/AI infrastructure and the base blockchain. The architecture prioritizes low-latency task assignment, verifiable execution, and economic security through staking.

## System Components

### 1. Operator Registry

The Operator Registry is an on-chain program that manages the lifecycle of operators:

- **Registration**: Operators register with a name, capabilities vector, and initial stake
- **Staking**: Operators must maintain minimum stake to remain eligible for task assignment
- **Reputation**: On-chain reputation score based on task completion rate and uptime
- **Slashing**: Misbehaving operators lose stake proportional to the severity of the fault

### 2. Task Execution Engine

The Task Execution Engine handles the full lifecycle of tasks:

```
Submission -> Assignment -> Execution -> Verification -> Settlement
```

**Task Assignment Algorithm:**
- Weighted random selection based on stake and reputation
- Capability matching ensures operators can handle the task type
- Geographic proximity hints for latency-sensitive operations

### 3. Verification Layer

Tasks are verified through a combination of:
- **Optimistic verification**: Results accepted unless challenged within dispute window
- **ZK proofs**: For computation-intensive tasks, operators submit ZK proofs of correct execution
- **Multi-operator consensus**: Critical tasks require N-of-M operator agreement

### 4. Reward Distribution

Rewards are distributed from the protocol's reward pool:
- Base reward per task completion
- Bonus for speed (completing before timeout)
- Reputation multiplier for high-reputation operators

                                              |
                              +---------------+---------------+
                              |               |               |
                       [Assignment]    [Verification]   [Settlement]
                              |               |               |
                       [Operators]      [ZK Proofs]    [Token Transfer]
```

## Security Model

1. **Economic Security**: Operators risk slashing of staked tokens
2. **Cryptographic Security**: ZK proofs for verifiable computation
3. **Social Security**: Governance can pause/upgrade protocol parameters
4. **Redundancy**: Critical tasks assigned to multiple operators

## Program Accounts

| Account | Seeds | Description |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| ProtocolState | `["protocol_state"]` | Global protocol configuration |
| Operator | `["operator", authority]` | Per-operator state |
| Task | `["task", task_count]` | Per-task state |
| Vault | `["vault"]` | Staking token vault |
| RewardPool | `["reward_pool"]` | Reward distribution pool |

## Upgrade Path

The protocol uses Anchor's upgradeable BPF loader, allowing governance-controlled upgrades with a timelock mechanism.
